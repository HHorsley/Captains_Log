		<h2>We'd love to hear from you</h2>
	</br>
		<p>A bit about us. We're like you more or less. We've had a lot of serious thoughts, dramatic experiences, big decisions, ambitious visions, grand ideas, sad reflections. That's what makes life worth living. But we realized, we forget a lot of those details.</p>
		<p>That's normal of course, we're human. But it doesn't have to be that way. We want to live in a world where your family members can pass on logs to share parts of their journey with you. And where your logs will live on as a legacy that's more human than a statue or name on a building.</p>
		<p>Can you imagine that? We hope to help make it happen.</p>

						<p>Imagine if you could watch a video of your grandfather from his college days, talking about his first date with your grandma. <span>Imagine if you could watch a video of your 7-year-old self talking about what you want to be when you grow up. Imagine if you could give your 21-year-old daughter your log from when you had your first boss.<span></p>

						<p><span>This isn't social media.</span> A Captain's Log is a private library of your thoughts on video — yours to remind yourself of your past, to pass along to family in the future, or even destroy if you chose. Every few months, you schedule 20 minutes to do an interview through your webcam. You can respond to a custom list of questions, or be interviewed by a professional (anonymously) or a relative if you'd like. Quick, fun, and secure.</p>
